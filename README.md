# Phase Consistent Ecological Domain Adaptation

CVPR 2020

## A message from the authors

Hey guys! Welcome to this repository of our paper 'Phase Consistent Ecological Domain Adaptation', which is accepted by CVPR 2020. First things first, here's a link to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04923). Make sure to read it and you will like it. Currently we are organizing the code and will make it public available soon. Before we get our code ready, we'll first share our pretrained models that can reproduce the results presented in the paper. Check this out:

All above pre-trained models should be compatible with the [AdaptSegNet](https://github.com/wasidennis/AdaptSegNet) and [BDL](https://github.com/liyunsheng13/BDL) repositories. Shout out to these authors!
